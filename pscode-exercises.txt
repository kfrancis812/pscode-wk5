// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Input the number
Check if the number is divisible by 2
   a. If the remainder when the number is divided by 2 is 0, then Print "The number is even"
   b. Else Print "The number is odd"


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

input 5 numbers
sum of numbers
avgNumber = sum of numbers / 5
minNumber = min(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)
maxNumber = max(num1, num2, num3, num4, num5)

PRINT "The average of these numbers are " avgNumber
PRINT "The smallest number is " minNumber
PRINT "The largest number is " maxNumber
