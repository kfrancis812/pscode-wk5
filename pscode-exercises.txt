// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
=int1 + int2


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Number divided by 2
    If number is round number then even
    If number is not, then odd

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
    Start
    WRITE " Please enter 5 numbers"
    READ int1,int2,int3,int4,int5

   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
      avg = (int1+int2+int3+int4+int5)
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
    If (int1 < int2)
        Set max to int2
    Else
        Set max to int1
    If(int3 > max)
       Set max to int3
    If(int4 > max)
        Set max to int4
    If(int5 > max)
        Set max to int5
    WRITE "the max is"
    WRITE max
    END
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are
 WRITE "The average is"
        avg = (int1+int2+int3+int4+int5)
 WRITE "the max is"
    WRITE max
